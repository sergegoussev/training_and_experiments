    "The *infamous* Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means that you can only write synchronous (i.e. serial) programs — that operate one after the other. But you might often want to split your serial process and run a set of tasks in parallel. This tutorial will go over two types of common scenarios to set up parallel programming in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **parallel computing** — parallelizing a set of identical or similar tasks--usually to speed up the efficiency of your script;\n",
    "* **asynchchonous programming** — you might want to create a master scripts that turns on slaves and creates a simple way to properly shut them off as needed--instead of using keyboard interrupt--a kind of asynchronous processing similar to event listeners in *JavaScript*.\n",

    "### Master/slave approach\n",
    "The first method is to create a slave thread that does something, receiving objects from a master. Once objects end (i.e. a kill command is recevied), the slave ends automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, a slave thread is initiated, and it runs forever as it operates through a while True loop. Once a 'quit' command is recevied however, it exists the loop and ends on its own accord. In essense, this example is superfulous -- all it does is moves execution to a slave thread, while the master waits as the GIL does not allow it do anything else at the same time.\n",
