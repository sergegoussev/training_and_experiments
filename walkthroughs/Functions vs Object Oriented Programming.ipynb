    "# The benefits of functions\n",

    "When we first start writing code, we learn how to do it line-by-line. In other words, when we write the specific command we want to use right in the script, then press *Enter* and go to the next line, to write another command. Our first code often looks like it has a millio if statements. We quickly progress to loops, but we often still have a lot of repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing wrong with the line-by-line approach with repetition, its a great way to experiment and learn. However, what happens when you need to run the same types of commands (i.e. the code) a second time in your script? Well you copy paste the set of commands from the first time you used them, again lower in your script, right? Simple repetition is great, but what happens if you find out later you made a mistake in that copy-pasted code -- you will have to go through and fix it twice (or worse, more)! \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, when you are writing your script, you realize you have to do almost the same thing 2 or more times, but they are slightly different each time. You can write out the code differently for each time you need it. Again, this works fine, your chances of making mistakes, later finding those mistakes and debugging them all the harder. And not even mentioning that more code makes your computer slower when running your script as it needs to keep all those instructions in memory! \n",
