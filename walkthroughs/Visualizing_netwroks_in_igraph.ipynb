    "You've created a few networks, detected communities, and done some other basic analysis -- time to visualize the network and check if there are some discernable patterns! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 ways that *networks/graphs* can be visualized: \n",
    "* use your python library of choise to export a **gml** file (or other formats), which you can open using a visualizing app of your choice ([**gephi**](https://gephi.org/) is one of the most popular among researchers); or\n",
    "* continue using python to create visuals using code!\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the difference? Well for one, the size of your network. If you are talking about a few thousand (or dozen thousand) nodes, and a few hundred thousand edges, apps work great! If you are talking about millions of data points though, these apps start to struggle. **Gephi** for instance recommends that you use their app for networks of [up to 100,000 nodes and 1M edges](https://gephi.org/features/) (although I've used it with graphs several times that recommendations, and the result was okay, it just took a long time)! \n",
